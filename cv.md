## About me:
I was born in Svetlogorsk in 1990, and I am now 32 years old. For ten years I lived in Mogilev, where I studied at the BRU and worked at the Skoda dealership. Then my wife and I moved to Gomel, where I worked at the Skoda dealership, and then at Wurth. And for the last five years we have been living in this city. I have a lot of experience in sales and interpersonal relationships.
I love running, reading books and information technology. My main goal is to get a job at an IT company.

## My skills:
* Python
* HTML, CSS
* C#
* Version Control with Git
* Computer Science Basics
* Pycharm and VSC

## Code example:
```
a=[str.lower(i) for i in input().split()]
n=len(a)
j=0
d={}
for j in range(n):
    c=a.count(a[j])
    d[a[j]]=c
for key,value in d.items():
    print(key,value)
```
